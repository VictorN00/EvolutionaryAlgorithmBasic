# EvolutionaryAlgorithmBasic
Basic simulations using evolutionary algorithms (mostly genetic)

- genetic_basic.py simulates a simple population where speed is an favorable attribute
- knapsack_genetic_algorithm.py uses a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem
  - not guaranteed to find the optimal combination, verified by the dynamic programming solution
- cluster_ea.py implements a genetic algorithm to cluster around certain points
  - very similar to finding local or global minima/maxima except with 2D instead of 3D
